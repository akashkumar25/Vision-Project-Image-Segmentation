# Vision-Project-Image-Segmentation

#### In this project we implemented the image segmentation using three different models for three different task.

#### Task1:

For this task we have implemented Vgg-16 pretrained model on PascalVoc 2012 Dataset. We got the F1- score of 0.8560 and Dice-coeffiecient as 0.7482.

#### Task2:

For this task we have to implement exactly same R2-UNet model given in this paper https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1802/1802.06955.pdf on CityScape dataset. We got the training accuracy as 0.9904, sensitivity as 0.8713, specificity as 0.9950, F1-score as 0.8713, and Jaccard score as 0.7720 and testing accurracy as 0.9843, sensitivity as 0.8042, specificity as 0.9918, F1-score as 0.8042, and Jaccard score as 0.6725.

#### Task 3:
